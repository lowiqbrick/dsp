This repository is for a tool that helps you to play the video game Dyson Sphere Program.
It is a Factorio-ish game in which you mine resources an process those into other items.
This requires to take recipes and the ration between these into account. I don't think that that aspect of the game is intriguing. As a result i want a binary that gets the name an production rate of an item and generates me a list of things to produce and tells me how many assemblers, smelters, etc are required to manufacture at the rate i desire. Also some options are included to make it more convenient.
